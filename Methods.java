// Create a class with the name "TryingMethods"
// Add comments to describe what this class does
// Add the main method to this class
// Add at least four methods in this class
// Two of the method should be dynamic and the other two static

// One of the dynamic methods should have an integer as an argument. It return a string of the day of the week based on the argument that was provided. Use a switch case in the body of the method.

// The second dynamic method should return nothing but just print a message to the console using an if statement with at least 3 blocks. The conditions of the statement should be based on the argument or parameter(s) of the method.

// One of the static methods uses a while loop to find the sum of all numbers less than 1000 and return the result.

// Lastly, the last method uses a for loop to find the sum of even numbers between 12 and 103.

// Push your codes to GitHub with at least 5 commits. Ensure to use at least 5 branches to manage your code.

// Find someone, whom you will collaborate with. The collaborator will be the one to accept the PRs you raise.

// Thank you and happy coding.
